## How to install?
This software isn't even in its alpha stages! As such I will not provide any installation steps.
You can still install this, its Laravel Based, but if you suffer leaks/hacks i'm not reponsible. 
I already told you that this is not even alpha software **DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**

An alpha will get released when I feel it's safe and stable enough.
